from ravenframework.CodeInterfaceBaseClass import CodeInterfaceBase

class Neutrino(CodeInterfaceBase):
  
    Provides code to interface RAVEN to Neutrino code
    The name of this class represents the type in the RAVEN input file
    e.g.
    &lt;Models&gt;
      &lt;Code name="myName" subType="Neutrino"&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/Code&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Models&gt;

  

  def generateCommand(self, inputFiles, executable, clargs=None,fargs=None,preExec=None):
    
      See base class.  Collects all the clargs and the executable to produce the command-line call.
      Returns tuple of commands and base file name for run.
      Commands are a list of tuples, indicating parallel/serial and the execution command to use.
      @ In, inputFiles, list, List of input files (length of the list depends on the number of inputs have
            been added in the Step is running this code)
      @ In, executable, string, executable name with absolute path (e.g. /home/path_to_executable/code.exe)
      @ In, clargs, dict, optional, dictionary containing the command-line flags the user can specify in the input
            (e.g. under the node &lt; Code &gt;&lt; clargstype =0 input0arg =0 i0extension =0 .inp0/ &gt;&lt; /Code &gt;)
      @ In, fargs, dict, optional, a dictionary containing the axuiliary input file variables the user can specify
            in the input (e.g. under the node &lt; Code &gt;&lt; clargstype =0 input0arg =0 aux0extension =0 .aux0/ &gt;&lt; /Code &gt;)
      @ Out, returnCommand, tuple, tuple containing the generated command. returnCommand[0] is the command to
            run the code (string), returnCommand[1] is the name of the output root
    
    found = False
    &#47&#47 Find the first file in the inputFiles that is an XML, which is what we need to work with.
    for index, inputFile in enumerate(inputFiles):
      if self._isValidInput(inputFile):
        found = True
        break
    if not found:
      raise Exception(&quotNo correct input file has been found. Got: &quot+&quot &quot.join(inputFiles))

    &#47&#47Determines the path to the input file
    path = inputFiles[0].getAbsFile()

    &#47&#47Creates the output file that saves information that is outputted to the command prompt
    &#47&#47The output file name of the Neutrino results
    outputfile = &quotresults&quot

    &#47&#47Creates run command tuple ([&quotexecutionType&quot,&quotexecution command&quot], output file root)
    &#47&#47The path to the Neutrino executable is specified in the RAVEN input file as the executable
    &#47&#47 since it must change directories to run
    executablePath = executable.replace("Neutrino.exe","")
    returnCommand = [(&quotserial&quot,&quotcd &quot + executablePath + &quot && &quot + executable + &quot --nogui --file &quot + str(path) \
    + &quot --run&quot)], outputfile

    return returnCommand

  def _isValidInput(self, inputFile):
    
      Check if an input file is a Neutrino input file.
      @ In, inputFile, string, the file name to be checked
      @ Out, valid, bool, &quotTrue&quot if an input file has an extension of &quot.nescene&quot, otherwise &quotFalse&quot.
    
    valid = False
    if inputFile.getExt() in (&quotnescene&quot):
      valid = True
    return valid

  def getInputExtension(self):
    
      Return a tuple of possible file extensions for a simulation initialization file (i.e., dsin.txt).
      @ In, None
      @ Out, validExtensions, tuple, tuple of valid extensions
    
    validExtensions = (&quotnescene&quot)
    return validExtensions

  def createNewInput(self, currentInputFiles, oriInputFiles, samplerType, **Kwargs):
    
      Generate a new OpenModelica input file (XML format) from the original, changing parameters
      as specified in Kwargs[&quotSampledVars&quot]
      @ In , currentInputFiles, list,  list of current input files (input files of this iteration)
      @ In , oriInputFiles, list, list of the original input files
      @ In , samplerType, string, Sampler type (e.g. MonteCarlo, Adaptive, etc. see manual Samplers section)
      @ In , Kwargs, dictionary, kwarded dictionary of parameters. In this dictionary there is another
             dictionary called "SampledVars" where RAVEN stores the variables that got sampled
             (e.g. Kwargs[&quotSampledVars&quot] =&gt; {&quotvar1&quot:10,&quotvar2&quot:40})
      @ Out, newInputFiles, list, list of newer input files, list of the new input files (modified and not)
    
    &#47&#47 Look for the correct input file
    found = False
    for index, inputFile in enumerate(currentInputFiles):
      if self._isValidInput(inputFile):
        found = True
        break
    if not found:
      raise Exception(&quotNo correct input file has been found. Got: &quot+&quot &quot.join(oriInputFiles))

    originalPath = currentInputFiles[index].getAbsFile()
    originalPath = os.path.abspath(originalPath)

    &#47&#47 Since the input file is XML we can load and edit it directly using etree
    &#47&#47 Load the XML into a tree:
    tree = ET.parse(originalPath, ET.XMLParser(encoding=&quotutf-8&quot))
    &#47&#47 get the root node
    root = tree.getroot()

    &#47&#47 grep the variables that got sampled
    varDict = Kwargs[&quotSampledVars&quot]

    &#47&#47 Go through sampled variables
    for var in varDict:
      &#47&#47Search for the SPH solver properties
      &#47&#47NIISphSolver_1 name may need to be changed based on Neutrino input file
      &#47&#47Can add other properties to change beside the solver properties
      for element in root.findall(&quot./properties/Scene/NIISphSolver_1/&quot):
        &#47&#47Search for the Radius property
        if element.get(&quotname&quot) == &quotParticleSize&quot:
          &#47&#47Set the radius value to the sampled value
          element.set(&quotval&quot,str(varDict[var]))

        &#47&#47Change where the measurements and the output data is stored in the input file to match RAVEN location
        &#47&#47Search for the Base properties
        for elementBase in root.findall(&quot./properties/Base/&quot):
          &#47&#47Search for the SceneFilePath property
          if elementBase.get(&quotname&quot) == &quotSceneFilePath&quot:
            &#47&#47Set the SceneFilePath
            elementBase.set(&quotval&quot, str(originalPath))

          &#47&#47Search for the SaveDir property
          if elementBase.get(&quotname&quot) == &quotSaveDir&quot:
            &#47&#47Create and set SaveDir
            &#47&#47NeutrinoInput.nescene needs to be changed to the Neutrino input file name
            savePath = originalPath.replace("NeutrinoInput.nescene","",1)
            elementBase.set(&quotval&quot,str(savePath))

          if elementBase.get(&quotname&quot) == &quotCacheDir&quot:
            &#47&#47Create and set CacheDir
            &#47&#47NeutrinoInput.nescene needs to be changed to the Neutrino input file name
            cachePath = originalPath.replace("NeutrinoInput.nescene","",1)
            elementBase.set(&quotval&quot,str(cachePath))

        &#47&#47Search for the Measurement field properties
        &#47&#47MeasurementField_1 name may need to be changed based on Neutrino input file
        for elementMeas in root.findall(&quot./properties/Scene/MeasurementField_1/&quot):
          &#47&#47Search for the exportPath property
          if elementMeas.get(&quotname&quot) == &quotexportPath&quot:
            &#47&#47Create and set the exportPath
            &#47&#47NeutrinoInput.nescene needs to be changed to the Neutrino input file name
            exportPath = originalPath.replace("NeutrinoInput.nescene","",1)
            exportPath = exportPath + r"\Measurements\results.csv"
            elementMeas.set(&quotval&quot,str(exportPath))


    &#47&#47 Now we can re-write the input file
    tree.write(originalPath)

    return currentInputFiles

  def finalizeCodeOutput(self, command, output, workingDir):
    
    Called by RAVEN to modify output files (if needed) so that they are in a proper form.
    In this case, even if this simple code dumps the results into a CSV, we are going to read
    the .out file that is in ASCI format, just to show how to use this method
    @ In, command, string, the command used to run the ended job
    @ In, output, string, the Output name root
    @ In, workingDir, string, current working dir
    @ Out, newOutputRoot, string, present in case the root of the output file gets changed in this method.
    
    &#47&#47 create full path to the outputfile
    &#47&#47 NeutrinoInput needs to be the name of the Neutrino Input file
    &#47&#47 Name of results file name needs to be the same as in the createNewInput function
    outputPath = os.path.join(workingDir, "NeutrinoInput", "Measurements", "results.csv")

    &#47&#47Change the output path so RAVEN can read the output
    newOutputPath = os.path.join(workingDir, output)

    &#47&#47 check that the output file exists
    &quot&quot&quotif not os.path.exists(outputPath):
      print(&quotResults file does not exist. OK if during test.&quot)
      return newOutputPath&quot&quot&quot

    &#47&#47 open original output file (the working directory is provided)
    <a id="change">outputFile = open(outputPath,"r+")</a>

    &#47&#47Open the new output file so the results can be written to it and put in the form for RAVEN to read
    <a id="change">resultsFile = open(newOutputPath + ".csv", &quotw&quot)</a>

    lines = outputFile.readlines()

    &#47&#47Needed for RAVEN to read output
    &#47&#47These need to match RAVEN input file output names
    resultsFile.write(&quottime,result\n&quot)

    &#47&#47Write Neutrino results to a new file for RAVEN
    for line in lines:
      resultsFile.write(line)

    <a id="change">resultsFile</a><a id="change">.close()</a>

    <a id="change">outputFile</a><a id="change">.close()</a>

    return newOutputPath
