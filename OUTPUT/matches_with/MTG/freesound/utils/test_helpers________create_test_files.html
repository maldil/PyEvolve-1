sound_counter = count()  &#47&#47 Used in create_user_and_sounds to avoid repeating sound names

    Creates User, Sound and Pack objects useful for testing.

    A counter is used to make sound names unique as well as other fields like md5 (see `sound_counter` variable).
    NOTE: creating sounds requires License objects to exist in DB. Do that by making sure your test case loads
    &quotlicenses&quot fixture, i.e. "fixtures = [&quotlicenses&quot]".

    Args:
        num_sounds (int): N sounds to generate.
        num_packs (int): N packs in which the sounds above will be grouped.
        user (User): user owner of the created sounds (if not provided, a new user will be created).
        count_offset (int): start counting sounds at X.
        tags (str or None): string of tags to be added to the sounds (all sounds will have the same tags).
        processing_state (str): processing state of the created sounds.
        moderation_state (str): moderation state of the created sounds.
        type (str): type of the sounds to be created (e.g. &quotwav&quot).

    Returns:
        (Tuple(User, List[Pack], List[Sound]): 3-element tuple containing the user owning the sounds,
            a list of the packs created and a list of the sounds created.

def override_path_with_temp_directory(fun, settings_path_name):
    
    Decorator that wraps a function inside two context managers which i) create a temporary directory; and ii) override
    a settings path to that temporary directory. When the wrapped function exits, the created temporary will be
    deleted and the settings override reverted. This will happen even if the function exists with an Exception. This
    is useful in unit tests which write files to disk and we want to make sure these are deleted after the test has
    finished running.
