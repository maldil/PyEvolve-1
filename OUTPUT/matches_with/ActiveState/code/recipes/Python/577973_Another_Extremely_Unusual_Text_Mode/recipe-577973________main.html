&#47&#47 DC_IN.py
&#47&#47
&#47&#47 This DEMO shows how to get DC, (Direct Current), into a computer without
&#47&#47 the need for Integrated Cirduits, USB, Serial, Parallel etc, etc...
&#47&#47 It is used in this code as a very simple Logic Probe that will give some
&#47&#47 indication of a Logic 0, 1 or indeterminate. Only the external microphone input
&#47&#47 is required. "/dev/dsp" IS required so install "oss-compat" from your distro&quots
&#47&#47 repository if you do not have "/dev/dsp"...
&#47&#47 Ensure the sound system is not in use, and, use the OS&quots mixing facilities to
&#47&#47 set any input and output levels...
&#47&#47 Tested on Debian 6.0.0 using Python 3.1.3 and PCLinuxOS 2009 using Python 3.2.2.
&#47&#47 (C)2010, B.Walker, G0LCU. Now issued as Public Domain.
&#47&#47 Written in such a way that anyone can understand how it works.
&#47&#47
&#47&#47 A very simple VCO, (Voltage COntrolled Oscillator), can be found here...

&#47&#47
&#47&#47 Assume a supply rail of 5 Volts to the VCO along with the circuit of the probe below...
&#47&#47
&#47&#47 +5 Volt rail on VCO, (Vcc).

def main():
	&#47&#47 Make variables global; my choice... ;o)
	global record
	global n
	global freq
	global logic
	global LED
	global colour
	&#47&#47 Set the startup values...
	<a id="change">freq=0</a>
	<a id="change">record=b"?"</a>
	<a id="change">n=0</a>
	<a id="change">logic="0"</a>
	&#47&#47 Use "H" for this DEMO although the commented out "LED" may look better.
	<a id="change">LED="H"</a>
	&#47&#47 LED=chr(0x2588)
	<a id="change">colour="\033[1;32m"</a>
	while 1:
		&#47&#47 Do a 1 second recorded burst...
		<a id="change">audio=open(&quot/dev/dsp&quot, &quotrb&quot)</a>
		&#47&#47 "record" is the "binary string" to be counted...
		<a id="change">record=audio.read(8000)</a>
		<a id="change">audio</a><a id="change">.close()</a>
		&#47&#47 Enter another loop to do the count...
		<a id="change">n=0</a>
		<a id="change">freq=0</a>
		while 1:
			&#47&#47 A VCO with a mark to space ratio of 1 to 1 will be used for this DEMO,
			&#47&#47 so "wait" until a "space" is found.
			&#47&#47 (For those that don&quott know.)
			&#47&#47
			&#47&#47                  +------+      +---
			&#47&#47 Square wave:-    | Mark |Space |
			&#47&#47               ---+      +------+
			&#47&#47
			&#47&#47 This ensures that the loop cycles when NO input is
			&#47&#47 applied to the microphone socket.
			&#47&#47 Exit this loop when "mark" is found or n&gt;=8000...
			while record[n]&lt;=127:
				<a id="change">n=n+1</a>
				&#47&#47 Ensure as soon as n&gt;=8000 occurs it drops out of the loop.
				if n&gt;=8000: break
			&#47&#47 Ensure as soon as n&gt;=8000 occurs it drops completely out of this loop.
			if n&gt;=8000: break
			&#47&#47 Now the "mark" can loop until a "space" is found again and the whole
			&#47&#47 can cycle until n&gt;=8000...
			while record[n]&gt;=128:
				<a id="change">n=n+1</a>
				&#47&#47 Ensure as soon as n&gt;=8000 occurs it drops out of the loop.
				if n&gt;=8000: break
			&#47&#47 Ensure as soon as n&gt;=8000 occurs it drops completely out of this loop.
			if n&gt;=8000: break
			&#47&#47 "freq" will become the frequency of a symmetrical waveform
			&#47&#47 when the above loops are finally exited, n&gt;=8000...
			&#47&#47 Tick up the freq(uency) per "mark to space" cycle.
			<a id="change">freq=freq+1</a>
			&#47&#47 Just 3 levels are displayed here but with more "if" statements much more
			&#47&#47 accuracy and range is easily possible. Also "look up tables" could be used if desired...
			&#47&#47 Set colour to Green for Logic 0, Red for Logic 1 and Yellow for indeterminate.
			&#47&#47 Logic 1 is approximately greater than 4 Volts.
			if freq&gt;=3000:
				<a id="change">logic="1"</a>
				&#47&#47 Red...
				<a id="change">colour="\033[1;31m"</a>
			&#47&#47 Logic 0 is approximately less than 1 Volt.
			if freq&lt;=300:
				<a id="change">logic="0"</a>
				&#47&#47 Green...
				<a id="change">colour="\033[1;32m"</a>
			&#47&#47 Indeterminate is between 1 and 4 Volts and/or a slow oscillation being measured...
			if freq&gt;=301 and freq&lt;=2999:
				<a id="change">logic="indeterminate"</a>
				&#47&#47 Yellow...
				<a id="change">colour="\033[1;33m"</a>
		&#47&#47 An ultra simple clear screen line...
		&#47&#47 This line is not needed for the demo but added for fullness...
		print("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
		&#47&#47 Now display the value in the same place on screen every time.
		&#47&#47 This assumes a 24 or 25 line Python Shell window. Just modify to
		&#47&#47 suit your particular Shell that you use...
		print("\033[0m\nSimple DC Input in the guise of a TTL level Logic Probe.\n")
		print("(C)2010-2011, B.Walker, G0LCU. Issued as Public Domain.\n\n\n")
		&#47&#47 Print a large coloured square "LED" for quick and easy viewing.
		for n in range (0,3,1):
			print("                                     "+colour+LED+LED+LED+LED+LED+LED)
		print("\033[0m\n\n\nLogic level is "+colour+logic+"\033[0m...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
