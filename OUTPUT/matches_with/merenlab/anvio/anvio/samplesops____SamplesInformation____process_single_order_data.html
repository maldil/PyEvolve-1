           For instance, anvi&quoto uses "X;Y;Z" notation to define a field for bar charts.

        &#47&#47 if you are reading this line, please brace yourself to possibly one of the silliest
        &#47&#47 bunch of lines in the anvi&quoto codebase. the reason we are doing this this way is quite
        &#47&#47 a long story, and deserves a FIXME, but in order to utilize the excellent function
        &#47&#47 in the filesnpaths module to check the contents of the samples order dict rigirously,
        &#47&#47 we need to have this information in a file. a better way could have been implementing
        &#47&#47 a filesnpaths.is_proper_samples_order_content function next to the currently available
        &#47&#47 filesnpaths.is_proper_samples_order_file (the latter would call the former with a dict
        &#47&#47 and it would be much more flexible), but we can&quott import utils form within filesnpaths.
        &#47&#47 without utils we don&quott have a get_TAB_delimited_file_as_dictionary function, and we are
        &#47&#47 definitely not going to implement it in two places :( recovering from a poor design by
        &#47&#47 doing something even poorer? couldn&quott have we fixed this once and for all instead of
        &#47&#47 writing this paragraph? well. just remember that you are thinking about a rethorical
        &#47&#47 question in a comment section. so sometimes we do things that are not quite productive.
